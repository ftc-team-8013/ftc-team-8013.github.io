#Android Studio
What is Android Studio? Android Studio is the main way that we program in FTC. This is because all of our devices on the robot run Android. Android Studio is also the IDE or integrated development environment for Android app development. If you want to make an Android app use Android Studio. If you want to program and FTC robot you use Android Studio. Android Studio is what we use to write the code. It is not the actual programming language.
