In FTC programming there are a few things that you should know. This will be a guide on programming for First Tech Challege. **REMINDER: If you need help ask someone more experienced than you.**

# Android Studio
What is Android Studio? Android Studio is the main way that we program in FTC. This is because all of our devices on the robot run Android. Android Studio is also the IDE or integrated development environment for Android app development. If you want to make an Android app use Android Studio. If you want to program and FTC robot you use Android Studio. Android Studio is what we use to write the code. It is not the actual programming language.

# Java
Android Studio we use to write the code but Java is the actual language that we write in. When I say language I'm not refering to English, French, or Chinese I'm talking about programming languages. Each language has pros and cons like python is a good language to learn but not the best for making games. Java is a good multi-purpose language for back-end development (making things work, front-end development is like making a website).

## Java in FTC
Well we went into what Java is but what do we use it for. Well with FTC java is used to make the robot move with different packages and different libraries made by FIRST. There's not much to it.

# TeleOp (Driver Controlled)
TeleOp or the Driver Controlled is one of the most important programs there is. Even though it is the simplest program it gets us the most points and the programmer who works on this needs to communicate with both drivers to make it easy for them to do their job. There are many parts to the TeleOp which is the same for the Autonomous but for this wesite it will only be explained for the TeleOp program.

## Initializing motors
Initializing motors is how we are able to reference physical hardware with the code.
