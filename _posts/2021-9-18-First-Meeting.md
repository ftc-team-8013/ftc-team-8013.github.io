The first meeting and season kickoff is important for every FTC team so they can learn about the season ahead and plan for what's to come. Today we did just that. From around 12:00-12:30 we watched the season kickoff to learn about the game and after that we brainstormed a couple ways to complete challenges. We were mainly focusing on two issues, picking up frieght and overcomming the terrain/barrier.

With solving the two problems we fround that we have already made mechanisms to solve both of these in previous years. We already have a grabbing mechanism from SkyStone which we can use as a base or prototype, and for terrain/barrier crossing we may just be able to raise the robot above the ground more. We are currently trying to impliment both into the current plans for the robot.
