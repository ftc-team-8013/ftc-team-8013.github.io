title: First Planning Session
---

Today was our first planning session. We started planning how to drive over the terrain and how to pick up the freight. We also learned what GitHub does and how to use it. Some of the newcommers also spent time learning how to drive the robot. We had a lot of extremely good ideas and we spent time on teaching the the fundementals so everyone knows how to do a little bit of everything.

One of the mechanisms that we thought of is an adjustible ramp to drop the freight onto the shipping hubs. This would work by having a swing type thing where the end of the swing had a moving conveyor belt which is always level so we can adjust the height and the amount the convey is forward. Another idea that people had is making a forklift. One issue with this is moving the frieght off the lift. This would allow us to adjust the height without adjusting the amount it moves forward, this makes it so we have more control. The third idea that we had was to reuse a mechanism from SkyStone and add essentially a mechanical arm so if you pull a string all of the fingers move to the shape of the object.

We are always trying to improve on ideas, make new ones, and implement old ones. There will be more ideas and changes to old ones as the season progresses so if anything changes it will go here.
